<body style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto; font-family: sans-serif; padding: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> April 16, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Home Keeper – Smart Inventory</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your personal data through our mobile applications on Android and iOS.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email Address</strong> – for user authentication and inventory collaboration</li>
    <li><strong>Camera & Storage Access</strong> – for attaching photos to items and extracting text using ML Kit and OpenAI</li>
    <li><strong>Microphone Access</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data</strong> – including crash logs and interaction data via Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To authenticate users and enable app access</li>
    <li>To store and manage inventory data in Firebase</li>
    <li>To extract text from images using ML Kit and OpenAI</li>
    <li>To analyze usage and crashes to improve the app</li>
    <li>To provide smart inventory queries using OpenAI APIs</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. AI Credit Usage Tracking</h2>
  <p>
    If you use features powered by OpenAI (such as smart item suggestions or AI assistant queries), we may record limited data about your usage of these features, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Number of AI requests made</li>
    <li>Total tokens consumed (prompt + completion)</li>
    <li>AI model used (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-3.5)</li>
    <li>Timestamp of your requests</li>
    <li>Internal feature that triggered the request</li>
    <li>Country where the request was made (determined by IP)</li>
    <li>If country resolution fails, the anonymized IP address is temporarily stored</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This information is used to monitor feature usage, manage free credit or subscription limits, detect abuse, and improve our services.
    None of the AI-generated responses or prompt content is stored in a way that links them to your identity.
    We do not share AI usage logs with third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
  <p>We use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Firebase</strong> (Google LLC): authentication, analytics, crash reporting, and data storage – 
      <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>ML Kit (by Google)</strong>: We use Google's ML Kit on-device Text Recognition to extract text from images you provide while creating or editing inventory items. This text extraction happens entirely on your device, and your image is not transmitted to Google servers. However, ML Kit may send anonymized usage and performance metrics to Google to improve their services.  
      Learn more at <a href="https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/terms" target="_blank">ML Kit Terms & Privacy</a>.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>OpenAI</strong>: We use OpenAI's API in two ways. First, we use it to power the AI assistant for smart inventory queries. Second, after extracting text from your image using ML Kit, we send that text along with the inventory field list to OpenAI’s API to generate intelligent suggestions for filling out item details. This means the extracted text is transmitted to OpenAI’s servers for processing.  
      Review OpenAI's <a href="https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies" target="_blank">Usage Policies</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> for more details.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Private Sharing and Collaborators</h2>
  <p>
    Users may choose to share their inventory data with specific individuals (such as family or friends) by inviting them via email.
    Shared access is strictly private and limited to explicitly invited collaborators.
    The app does not publicly display, broadcast, or host any user-generated content for public or community access.
  </p>
  
  <h2>6. User Content Guidelines</h2>
  <p>Users are prohibited from uploading or submitting any content that is sexually explicit, abusive, or violates applicable laws. We reserve the right to remove inappropriate content and suspend accounts that violate these rules.</p>
